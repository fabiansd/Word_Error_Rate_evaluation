How to run:

python werForMultipleTxt.py case/vendor

example: python werForMultipleTxt.py conversation/google


All txt files must be in UTF-8 format, otherwise the script will crash due to nordic letters. 
If a txt file is not in UTF-8, simply convert the txt file with notepad++. 
Go to Encoding -> Convert to UTF-8, then save.


IMPORTANT

To create new tests, follow this folder structure:

CASE-folder
	VENDOR-folder
		HYPOTHESES-folder
			Hypothesis to test saved as txt
		SOLUTION-folder
			A solution to the hypothesis
